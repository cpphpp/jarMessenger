- This is an instant messaging application that I've made a while ago.


## How To Use
- When you launch the app, you will see a login screen.
- If you are an anyMessenger user, you can log in directly.
- If this is your first time using this and you don't have an account, register.
- When you log in, console user will send you a message, welcoming you to the platform.
- Menu is very easy so you won't have a problem using the app.
- **Important**: You might have a problem connecting to the server. And some steps might take longer than expected due to slow connection.

## Installation
- You need to have Java 11 or Java 8 on your machine.
- Executable jar file is in jarMessenger.zip
